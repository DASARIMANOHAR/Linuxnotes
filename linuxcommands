lets know about terminals in windows

Command Prompt (CMD):
Basic tool used to run simple commands. It’s like a traditional command-line tool from MS-DOS days.

PowerShell:
Advanced tool designed for power users and automation. It can do everything CMD does and much more 
— like controlling Windows settings, managing files, automating tasks, etc.

======================================================================================================


Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) based on Unix. It acts as a bridge between computer hardware and software.
Like Windows or macOS, Linux helps your system run programs, manage files, and connect to devices.

Key Features of Linux
Open-source: Free to use, modify, and distribute.

Secure: Has strong permissions and user control.

Stable: Rarely crashes, even under heavy load.

Multi-user: Supports multiple users at the same time.

Customizable: You can change almost anything.

📦 Popular Linux Distributions (Distros)
Each Linux distro comes with its own tools and desktop environments:

ubuntu – beginner-friendly
Fedora 
Debian
CentOS
Kali Linux

🖥️ Where Linux is Used
Servers (web, mail, database servers)

Desktops and laptops

Embedded systems (smart TVs, routers)

Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure)

Supercomputers and IoT devices



WSL- windows sub system for Linux 
wsl has 2 version

WSL and WSL2

WSL2 is updated version support wide range of activities

WSL2 Advantage
✅Real Linux Kernel 
✅Full Compatibility
✅Docker Support	
✅Kubernetes Support 


So to install wsl2 we need to enable virtual machine platform and windows sub system for Linux in our windows system

after that install ubuntu and update it and check 
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04 run in command prompt

open ubuntu 
🧪 Basic Commands to Start
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y  # Update system
ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, touch, nano         # File operations


Linux credentials
user name: dasa_linux
pass: server123



Linux commands

1. Using touch (creates an empty file)

touch filename.txt
➡️ This creates a new, empty file named filename.txt.

2. Using echo (adds content to the file, if already file has text also it will modify )
echo "Hello, world!" > file.txt
➡️ This creates file.txt and writes "Hello, world!" inside it.

3. Using cat (manual input)
cat > newfile.txt
Then type the content and press Ctrl + D to save and exit.
to stop command press ctrl +c

4. Using nano, vim, or vi (text editors)
nano example.txt
Type your content

Press Ctrl + O to save

Press Ctrl + X to exit














clear   = use to clear the screen
mkdir    = make directory
rm -rf    =remove files or directory
###
Difference Between ls Options
ls → shows only normal files.
ls -a → shows all files (including hidden).
ls -la → shows all files with details (permissions, owner, size, date).
#####
pwd   = present working directory
cd    = change directory
cd ..  = change directory to parent directory
ls -ltr= shows the all permissions of files and when created

touch  = is only to create a file
vi or vim = is used to create and edit the file

man  = is used to known about every command details

history   = is used to know about what commands are used till now



chmod  = is change modification command is used to grant permissions

in simple format with number 
4=read
2=write
1= execute

suppose chmod 777 used 


7                       7          7
4+2+1                  4+2+1      4+2+1

User (Owner)           Group      Others

so above command chmod777 Everyone can read, write, execute → not safe, but sometimes used for testing.

we have some more like 755 700 644 600 400

Quick Memory Trick:

7 = rwx (4+2+1)

6 = rw- (4+2)

5 = r-x (4+1)

4 = r--

0 = ---






disk management

nproc = is used to check the total no.of cpu 

free -g = used to check the memory

df -h  = is used to check the disk space

top   = used to check all things 

echo  =  is used to print the statement you want(like printf in c language or console.log in javascript)

###############
a small script of file.ssh 


echo "print the cpu"
nproc  

####################
run the file.ssh


set -x  = is used to debug mode .simply it will show you the command that it is executing and print the output


ps -ef  = used to check the details of all process

ps -ef | grep "amazon"  = used to filter the process by using grep  

|   = is pipe command basically sends output of first command to the second command
ex: ps -ef | grep "amazon" 
in above the all details of process  will execute for ps -ef then sends output to grep "amazon" 

interview question

date | echo "today is"

what is output above script?


ps -ef | grep "agetty" | awk -F" " '{print $4}'  = used to again filter with awk command take output from column specified
 

 set -e  = used to exit the script when there is an error. suppose any errors exist but last command in the line is correct this command wont catch the error to overcome this below command is created(i.e set -e will not catch any pipe failures) 

 set -o pipefail  = used to catch any pipe failures 



curl URL.log | grep ERROR  = used to retrive errors in the logs


wget URL.log  = is actullay download the logfile (dummyfile.log) 

cat dummyfile.log | grep error

interview question what is difference btw wget curl

sudo  = use before any commands to have root previligies

sudo su - username = means switch user 

find / -name file1    = used to search over all files  of name file1


interview qus
trap    = traps the signals and perform execution onbehalf


<<<<<<< HEAD
locally changed some text from windows
=======


Linux commands

top  = monitor system performance like active process Real time info

htop = same as top command but better readability


ps = running process with id . it is not realtime  

ps aux = use to fetch about a specific process

pgrep nginx

ps aux | grep nginx

pstree -p = can view hierarchy of all process

netstat -tuln = to check which ports are have active connection

tupdump  = to check the late response from application . it will capture and analyze network packets for diagnosising issues.network troubleshooting
sudo tcpdumv -i ens5 port 80

ifconfig = will give you info primary network interface, when you create Linux instances enXoq , if others eth0

tcpdump -i ens5 = gives the all network packets info of your primary network interface

ping google.com = use to check response time from the destination address mentioned(google.com)

trace route = give all information details till endpoint of server

du -sh directory name = is used to check the storage of the directory(disk utilization)


free -h = to check memory utilization


when your dealing with services , to check the logs of runnings services
journalctl = gives you complete logs of services 

if want to check for specific service 
journalctl -u nginx


journalctl -b = use chatgtp


netstat -tuln to check active runnings ports 
below command check the process running in the port
lsof -i :53
